# SOLIENNE Paris Photo Dashboard Integration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete integration plan for SOLIENNE's Paris Photo 2025 production dashboard. The system has been designed with a hybrid Registry + Local storage pattern, feature-flagged rollout, and clean separation between public and private interfaces.

## Architecture Overview

### Three-Tier System Architecture
```
┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│   Public Interface  │  Production Team    │   Data Storage      │
├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤

│   site unchanged    │ • Dashboard         │   (consciousness)   │
│ • Gallery features  │ • Curation Tools    │ • localStorage      │
│   enhanced          │ • Production Mgmt   │   (curation data)   │
│ • New footer links  │ • Exhibition Preview│ • Feature flags     │
│   working           │ • Team Collaboration│   (rollout control) │
└─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

### Feature Flag System
```typescript
interface FeatureFlags {
  PARIS_PHOTO_DASHBOARD: boolean;    // Main dashboard access
  CURATION_TOOLS: boolean;           // Selection and grouping
  PRODUCTION_MANAGEMENT: boolean;    // Timeline and budget
  TEAM_COLLABORATION: boolean;       // Multi-user features
  PRESS_MATERIALS: boolean;          // PR integration
  EXHIBITION_PREVIEW: boolean;       // 3D preview mode
  ADMIN_MODE: boolean;               // Development override
}
```

## Phase Implementation Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation & Feature Flags (Days 1-3)
- **Feature flag system** implemented with environment variables

- **Role-based permissions** system
- **60-day countdown** to Paris Photo 2025

### ✅ Phase 3: Curation Tools Implementation (Days 7-10)
- **Thematic collections system** (5 collections, 20 pieces each)
- **Interactive stream selection** from 1740+ consciousness streams
- **Collection management** with progress tracking
- **Finalization workflow** for completed collections

### ✅ Phase 4: Production Management & Timeline (Days 11-15)
- **Milestone tracking system** with critical path management
- **Budget breakdown** (€33,000 total across 5 categories)
- **Team assignment** and status updates
- **Dependency tracking** for complex workflows

### ✅ Phase 5: Exhibition Preview & Press Materials (Days 16-20)
- **Exhibition layout visualization** across 4 gallery walls
- **Collection preview** with museum-quality specifications
- **Press kit integration** for materials generation
- **Technical specifications** for print production

### ✅ Phase 6: Infrastructure & Bug Fixes (Days 21-25)
- **Fixed broken footer links** (/api, /embed, /contact routes working)
- **Modal click-outside-to-close** functionality implemented
- **Enhanced CSS animations** for "ghost in the machine" effects
- **Navigation integration** with discrete team access point

## Data Flow Architecture

### Eden API Integration (Read-Only)
```typescript
// Primary consciousness stream source
fetchSolienneCreations() → 1740+ streams
fetchLatestCreation() → Real-time updates
```

### Local Storage (Curation Data)
```typescript
// Production-specific data
getCuratedCollections() → 5 thematic collections
getProductionMilestones() → 60-day timeline
getExhibitionLayouts() → Gallery arrangements
```

### Feature Flag Controls
```typescript
// Progressive rollout
getFeatureFlag('PARIS_PHOTO_DASHBOARD') → Main access
getFeatureFlag('CURATION_TOOLS') → Collection tools
getFeatureFlag('PRODUCTION_MANAGEMENT') → Timeline
```

## Team Access & Permissions

### Production Team Members
```
1. Archie (Exhibition Director)    - Full permissions
2. Alex (Production Manager)       - Production + logistics
3. Harry (Exhibition Designer)     - Layout + design
4. Christie (Press & Communications) - Press + marketing
5. Vlad (Logistics Coordinator)    - Logistics + shipping
6. Fran (Installation Manager)     - Installation + setup
```

### Authentication Flow
```
User → Team Login (/dashboard/paris-photo/login)
     → Token Validation (localStorage)
     → Dashboard Access (/dashboard/paris-photo)
     → Feature-Gated Tools (based on permissions)
```

## Progressive Rollout Strategy

### Stage 1: Development Testing ✅
```
ENABLE_PARIS_PHOTO_DASHBOARD=true
ENABLE_CURATION_TOOLS=true  
ENABLE_PRODUCTION_MANAGEMENT=true
```

### Stage 2: Limited Production (Week 1)
```
- Team login access for 2-3 core members
- Basic curation tools testing
- Data validation and backup procedures
```

### Stage 3: Full Team Access (Week 2)
```
- All 6 team members onboarded
- Full production timeline tracking
- Exhibition preview testing
```

### Stage 4: Enhanced Features (Week 3-4)
```
ENABLE_TEAM_COLLABORATION=true
ENABLE_PRESS_MATERIALS=true
ENABLE_EXHIBITION_PREVIEW=true
```

## Testing Procedures

### Unit Tests
- Feature flag system functionality
- Data storage/retrieval operations
- Authentication token validation
- Collection management workflows

### Integration Tests
- Eden API → Dashboard data flow
- localStorage persistence across sessions
- Team permission enforcement
- Feature flag toggling behavior

### User Acceptance Tests
- Team member login workflows
- Curation tool usability
- Production timeline accuracy
- Exhibition preview functionality

## Rollback Procedures

### Level 1: Feature Flag Rollback (Immediate)
```bash
# Disable specific features instantly
ENABLE_CURATION_TOOLS=false
ENABLE_PRODUCTION_MANAGEMENT=false
```

### Level 2: Route Rollback (5 minutes)
```bash
# Remove dashboard navigation link
# Redirect /dashboard/paris-photo/* to 404
```

### Level 3: Full System Rollback (15 minutes)
```bash
# Restore pre-integration codebase
git revert <integration-commit>
# Clear localStorage data
clearParisPhotoData()
```

### Level 4: Data Recovery (30 minutes)
```bash
# Restore from backup
localStorage.setItem('paris-photo-collections', backupData)
# Rebuild from Eden API source
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics
- **Dashboard usage**: Active team sessions
- **Curation progress**: Streams selected/collections completed
- **Feature adoption**: Flag usage analytics
- **Error rates**: Authentication failures, API errors
- **Performance**: Page load times, API response times

### Health Checks
- Eden API connectivity (consciousness streams)
- localStorage data integrity
- Team authentication status
- Feature flag synchronization
- Production milestone tracking

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Security
- Token-based team access (localStorage)
- Role-based permission enforcement
- Session timeout handling
- Access logging for audit trails

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data in public routes
- Team credentials not exposed in client code
- Feature flag validation on server side
- Curation data isolated to team members

### API Security
- Eden API key protection (server-side only)
- Rate limiting on consciousness stream fetching
- CORS policies for dashboard routes
- Input validation on all form submissions

## Migration Strategy

### Existing Site Impact: MINIMAL
```
✅ Public SOLIENNE site unchanged
✅ Eden API integration preserved
✅ Consciousness gallery fully functional
✅ All existing features working
✅ Footer links now operational
✅ Enhanced animations added
```

### New Features: ADDITIVE
```
+ Team authentication system
+ Production dashboard interface  
+ Curation tools for Paris Photo
+ Timeline and milestone tracking
+ Exhibition preview capabilities
+ Feature flag controlled rollout
```
